Why am I doing Masters?
General:
	Higher standard of life -- and solve higher standard of problems
Academic:
	Study extensively:
		Control Theory
		Computer Engineering
		Mathematics
			in a highly intensive and short period of time.
	Pursue PhD
		possibly in CalTech CDS program
Career:
	Become a good Control Systems Engineer
		Solve Control problems in Industry.

Why not Purdue?
General:
	Funding
	What will you do after aero degree
	Less interaction with the other department professors


Why UIUC?
Will you do PhD in UIUC?

Why not UIUC?
Will I get TA in Mathematics Department?
General:
	Got in to MS non-thesis and it might be hard to get in to thesis.
	Less number of IISTians
	More number of Indians
Professors:
	Timothy Bertl has ECE MS students as PhDs
	Soon Jo Chung is in CalTech now, so not possible to interact much
Labs:
	All Aero-control professors are working with CSL
