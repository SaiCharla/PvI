Why not Purdue?


Why UIUC?
General:
	It is ranked higher in overall categories.
Labs:
	Coordinate Science Laboratory -- Interdisciplinary Research in Controls
	Bertl Research Group
	Hei Wang Park Research Group
	Advanced Controls Laboratory
	Zachary R Putnam
	Melkoir Ornik
Professors:
	Timothy Bertl -- Manipulation of elastic objects
	Zachary Putnam -- autonomous aerobreaking
	Naira Navalokyam -- L1 Adapative Control
	Hei Wong Park -- Legged Robotics
	Melkoir Ornik -- Linear temporal Logic in control and Safety in Control

Why not UIUC?
General:
	Got in to MS non-thesis and it might be hard to get in to thesis.
Labs:
	No Aerospace Controls labs. All Aero control professors are working with CSL
